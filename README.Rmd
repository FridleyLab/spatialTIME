The goal of `spatialTIME` is to perform basic analysis and plotting of IF data from Vectra.

## Installation

You can install `spatialTIME` from GitHub with: 

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fridleylab/spatialTIME")
```

<!--- add CRAN once up and running --->

## Usage 

`spatialTIME` currently implements both univariate and bi-variate Ripley's K
analyses. The basis of the `spatialTIME` functions is the creation of the 
`mif` object. 

```{r, create_example_mif, echo = TRUE}

x <- create_mif(clinical_data = example_clinical,
                sample_data = example_summary,
                spatial_list = example_spatial,
                patient_id = "deidentified_id", sample_id = "deidentified_sample",
                clean_columns = TRUE)
x

```
